## Note about the third-party tools

In order to increase the reproducibility of the computational analyses we worked with conda environements and yml files to create them are given. Oherwise, softwares emboss (version 6.0) and R (version 4.1.2, including dplyr and ggplot2 libraries) are needed.

## Scripts and computing environment configuration

- aaFreqByPos.R: R script to create a graph 
- associate.sh: combines the measurements calculated for all species in a table (to run after compute.sh)
- compute.sh: compute measurements for one species (isoelectric point, CG%, Plong, Pavg, and P2nd)
- conda_env_Rbase_n_terminal_lysine.yml: recipe to create a conda environment and run R script
- conda_env_compute_n_terminal_lysine.yml: recipe to create a conda environment and run shell script
- get_nt.awk: get n fisrt nucleotides for each sequence of a multiple fasta file (used in compute.sh)
- transpose.awk: matrix transposition (used in compute.sh)

## Preparing data

selection of bacteria and archaea species: species were selected when they had a Topt_average and an Assembly_or_asseccion values in the [TEMPURA DB](http://togodb.org/db/tempura) and corresponding cDNA files (*cdna_from_genomics files.fasta.gz) were downloaded from the ncbi ftp site.

eukaryota selection: downloaded from ncbi assembly query with [eukaryotes[organism] AND â€œreference genome"[RefSeq Category]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/?term=eukaryotes%5borganism%5d+AND+%E2%80%9Creference+genome%22%5bRefSeq+Category%5d) added with green alga, african frog and fission yeast. 
Downloaded cDNA files versions (*_cds_from_genomic.fna.gz) are:
